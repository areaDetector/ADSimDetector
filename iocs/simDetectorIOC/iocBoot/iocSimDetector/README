This IOC can run on different platforms.  

To run on win32-x86 or windows-x64 with st.cmd.windows edit Makefile to set ARCH to win32-x86 or windows-x64,
then run "make clean", "make".  That will create envPaths.  Copy that file to envPaths.windows.

To run on linux-x86 with st.cmd.linux edit Makefile to set ARCH to linux-x86,
then run "make clean", "make".  That will create envPaths.  Copy that file to envPaths.linux.

To run on darwin-x86 with st.cmd.darwin edit Makefile to set ARCH to darwin-x86,
then run "make clean", "make".  That will create envPaths.  Copy that file to envPaths.darwin.

To run on vxWorks with st.cmd.vxWorks edit Makefile to set ARCH to vxWorks-ppc32,
then run "make clean", "make".  That will create cdCommands.  Copy that file to cdCommands.vxWorks.
